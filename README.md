# Project 3: SQL-for-Data-Analysis
In this project, I created Queries by using the Chinook Database that holds information about a digital music store to assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information and to help the company see how they might optimize.

I use SQLlite program for run the dataset and create the quires.
